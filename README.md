The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest known encryption techniques, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it for military communications. It is a type of substitution cipher where each character in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions to obtain the cipher text.
The Python program implementing the Caesar Cipher algorithm provides functionalities for both encryption and decryption, making it a simple yet effective cryptographic tool.

Technologies Used
This project is implemented using the following technologies:
1️⃣ Programming Language:
• Python: Used for writing the core logic of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption functions.

2️⃣ Libraries Used:
• Tkinter – Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for encryption and decryption.
• string – Provides access to standard character sets (alphabets) used in the encryption process.
• sys – Enables command-line interaction and user input handling.
• argparse (optional enhancement) – Can be used to handle command-line arguments for encrypting and decrypting text without manual input.

Features

✅ Text Encryption – Converts a given plaintext message into a coded format using a shift key.
✅ Text Decryption – Decodes a given encrypted message back to its original form.
✅ Customizable Shift Key – Users can define their own shift value for encryption and decryption.
✅ Case Sensitivity Handling – Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
✅ Encrypts All Characters – Letters, numbers, punctuation, and symbols are encrypted.
✅ Maintains Message Structure – Spaces and special characters are modified but preserved in position.
✅ Command-Line Interface (CLI) – Allows users to input messages directly via the terminal.
✅ Graphical User Interface (GUI) – Provides an interactive Tkinter-based interface for easier use.
✅ Scalability – Can be modified to work with different languages and larger datasets.
